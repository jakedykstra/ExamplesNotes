# Middleware

Middlewares are functions that take an action, an depending on the action it can decide to let it pass through, manipulate it, log it, or stop it

Can think of them as the gatekeeper, or bouncer. They inspect and determine if you get to go through

Install redux-promise. This is a very popular npm package for handling redux middleware
